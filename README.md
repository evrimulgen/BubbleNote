BubbleNote
==========

BubbleNote is an Android note-taking app that leverages Facebook Messenger's
chat heads concept for multi-tasking scenarios like:

  - taking notes while researching a topic on your phone / tablet
  - having a quick reminder stick around your screen without taking up too much
    space (à la Windows' sticky notes)

**NOTE**: this app is nowhere near usable right now, please check back later.
